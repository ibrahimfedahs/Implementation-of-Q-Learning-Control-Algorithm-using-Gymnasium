# Implementation of Q Learning Control Algorithm using Gymnasium

## Aim

To implement the **Q-Learning control algorithm** using the Gymnasium `FrozenLake-v1` environment and learn an optimal action-value function that enables the agent to select suitable actions for reaching the goal state while avoiding holes.

## Problem Statement



## Software Requirements



## Environment Description



## Theory

Q-Learning estimates the optimal action-value function directly.

The action-value function $Q(s,a)$ represents the expected return obtained when the agent takes action $a$ in state $s$, and then follows the best possible policy afterward.

The Q-Learning update rule is:

$$
Q(S_t,A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha
\left[
R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a} Q(S_{t+1},a) - Q(S_t,A_t)
\right]
$$

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $S_t$ | Current state |
| $A_t$ | Current action |
| $R_{t+1}$ | Reward received after taking action $A_t$ |
| $S_{t+1}$ | Next state |
| $\alpha$ | Learning rate |
| $\gamma$ | Discount factor |
| $Q(s,a)$ | Action-value function |
| $max_{a} Q(S_{t+1},a)$ | Maximum action value in the next state |

## Epsilon-Greedy Action Selection

During training, the agent uses epsilon-greedy action selection.

With probability $\epsilon$, the agent explores by selecting a random action.

With probability $1-\epsilon$, the agent exploits by selecting the action with the highest Q-value.

$$
a =
\begin{cases}
\text{random action}, & \text{with probability } \epsilon \\
\arg\max_{a} Q(s,a), & \text{with probability } 1-\epsilon
\end{cases}
$$
